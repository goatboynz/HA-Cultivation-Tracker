Rooms (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    room_type TEXT CHECK(room_type IN ('Clone', 'Veg', 'Flower', 'Dry', 'Storage')),
    description TEXT
)
```

### Enhanced Plants Table
```sql
Plants (
    -- Existing fields preserved
    growth_stage TEXT CHECK(growth_stage IN ('Clone', 'Veg', 'Flower')) DEFAULT 'Clone',
    room_id INTEGER,
    date_stage_changed DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (room_id) REFERENCES Rooms(id)
)
```

## üéØ User Experience Improvements
