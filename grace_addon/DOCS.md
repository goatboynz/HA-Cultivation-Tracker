# GRACe overview

GRACe has been designed to take as minimal "clicks" as possible to give you all the regulatory reporting you need, and as little extra as possible.

It's intention is to replace spreadsheets that some license holders have been using, with a faster system that is also more reliable. If data is entered incorrectly, it's a "feature" and not a "bug" that it can't easily be edited. Caution is expected.

However, because the amount of time required is so minimal (genuinely in the "seconds" per day realm), it should be able to be done relatively consistently by staff.

Backups are also taken as part of the Home Assistant backup regime, but ensuring that those are then sent externally to something such as Google Drive is the responsibility of the individual system administrator.

# First-run setup

When you first launch GRACe you'll be asked to enter your own company data. This is important because this data is used elsewhere in the Chain of Custody documents etc, so fill it out accurately. You can modify it later on, but it's best to start out with the correct information.

Next, on the Administration page, you will probably want to add some of the genetics that you're going to be working with. Go through and enter in all of the genetics you've got right now, or have flower from, or are likely to have in the future.

Finally, adding in a couple of verified companies is probably your "setup" step. Add in any external testing labs, and your offtake buyers details. These will be able to be selected from a drop-down list later on for when you go to send product.

# Getting started

Next you'll want to go in and receipt in some plants in the Tracking page. This is for any clones you take, any clones/plants received from another license holder, or declared under Form D.

Then when you go to harvest them at the end of the season, go into the "Harvest/Destroy/Send plants", select the number you're harvesting and choose "Process selected". It may be faster to tap the "select all" checkbox, and then uncheck a few mother-plants.

Next, once you've dried them, you can go into "Record dry weight change", select your genetics name, type in the weight you've harvested, choose "add" because we're adding weight to the running tally, and then choose "Harvested". If you'd received flower from another license holder (say, to see a sample of it before you got some genetics from them) you'd choose "Other".

# Reporting

To take care of your monthly reporting obligations, you'll need to go to Reporting and then choose "This months materials out (Flower+Plants)". If you're doing it after the end of the month has rolled over (but within the first 7 days of the new month) you'll want to choose last months option.

You will be automatically generated two tables:
- The first with all the flower out, including externally sent for testing
- The second with all the plants out, which is likely to be predominantly empty unless you're acting as a remote nursery and providing clones to another license holder.

It will automatically populate the address details that the Agency wants to see in the monthly report, along with all the other required information, so you can copy / paste it into an email to the Agency.

They will also want an annual stocktake as of the 1st January. You can simply choose "Annual Stocktake" under the Reporting page, select the year, and it will generate it all for you. You can even preview the current years by changing the date (though, we default to last year).
